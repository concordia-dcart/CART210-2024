# List of keywords related to new media.

The following list is constantly updated by the students throughout the term.

Each student must:

- add the two terms chosen to the list in a strict alphabetic order
- define the concept in their own words, with precision and conciseness
- cite their sources of information in strict Chicago author-year format. Three references minimum per entry, and two of them must be from academic sources (i.e., book, article, or conference paper). Add your bibliographic entry at the end of the list, in the right alphabetic order.
- provide links in the form of internal references to other terms in the glossary
- provide links to external references in the form of HTTP links

The glossary will be improved throughout the term, with three sprint deadlines.

##BigData
Big Data is the use of a large quantity of stored and analyzed information to form accurate understandings and predictions about the world. The wielding of this type of information processing has been accelerated by improvements in technology and the growing amounts of digital connections between people and organizations. 
Big Data is used in everything from health care to political campaigns. Notably big data was a cornerstone of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns where personalized messaging and interaction was optimized by the assessment of potential voter preferences (Landon-Murray 2016, 94). Large-scale data analysis was also used in the NBA to track player shooting accuracy. A sensor placed on the hoop would track and record the player’s shots from different points on the court. It would then be able to suggest where to shoot from to maximize winning potential. (Rice 2023, 1). 
In both of these examples, real-world phenomena were tracked and enumerated. They were then sent through systems and by people (data scientists) who would find patterns that could predict outcomes.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git,[^github24wikis] allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing. GitHub employs Git software, offering distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project wikis.[^kinsta24what]

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis).

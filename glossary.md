# List of keywords related to new media.

The following list is constantly updated by the students throughout the term.

Each student must:

- add the two terms chosen to the list in a strict alphabetic order
- define the concept in their own words, with precision and conciseness
- cite their sources of information in strict Chicago author-year format. Three references minimum per entry, and two of them must be from academic sources (i.e., book, article, or conference paper). Add your bibliographic entry at the end of the list, in the right alphabetic order.
- provide links in the form of internal references to other terms in the glossary
- provide links to external references in the form of HTTP links

The glossary will be improved throughout the term, with three sprint deadlines.

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis).
